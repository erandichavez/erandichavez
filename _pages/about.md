Hello! I am a second year Astronomy graduate student at Harvard University. Currently, I work with the Event Horizon Telescope to directly image Supermassive Black Holes with large arrays of radio telescopes. I'm particularly interested in Supermassive Black Hole Jets, and how they interact with their surrounding environments from the smallest to the largest scales. Before graduate school I worked on tracking long-term changes in Neptune's atmosphere and cloud activity.

I am also very interested in increasing the accessibility of Astronomy to marginalized communities through science education.
