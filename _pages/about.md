Hello! I am a second year Astronomy graduate student at Harvard University. Currently, I work with my advisor Michael Johnson and the Event Horizon Telescope to directly image Supermassive Black Holes with large arrays of radio telescopes. I'm particularly interested in Supermassive Black Hole Jets, and how they interact with their surrounding environments from the smallest to the largest scales. 

As an undergraduate student, I worked on tracking long-term changes in Neptune's atmospheric and cloud activity with Imke de Pater at UC Berkeley. Check out some articles about my work linking Neptune's cloud activity to the solar cycle featured on [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2023/hubble-neptunes-disappearing-clouds-linked-to-the-solar-cycle) and the [New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/18/science/neptune-clouds-sun.html)!

I am also very interested in increasing the accessibility of Astronomy to marginalized communities through science education.
